<p>
For the coding section, I would like for you to create a small ios App using UIKit following the Figma designs.

In the storyboard, please demonstrate your expertise in Constraints to design the different pages.</p>

Page 1:
Create a card by getting a random user from https://randomuser.me/
Clicking the card will proceed next page

Page 2:
A recorder with some of the userâ€™s data as shown on figma.
When the recording is done and when submit is pressed, save the recording to CoreData.

Page 3:
On this page, display more data as shown in the figma design with the ability to playback the recording.
Please upload the project to a public git repo and send it to me by a week from today, September 4th, 2024.
